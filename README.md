# bball-permutations
a look into permutation testing with an intentionally small data set for easy comprehension. 

the 'bball teams' file was created as a Jupyter Notebook file so it is saved as an HTML file and rendered here as a webpage. I used Jupyter Notebook as a way to show the coding I used, display the plots I was creating, and be able to use markdown to explain what I was doing in place.
